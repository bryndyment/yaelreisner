This one-bedroom temporary installation is being commissioned by Living Architecture and Artangel, two of Britain's leading cultural organisations.    Our team:&lt;br/&gt;Yael Reisner (Reg. Architect in Israel) with Bernd Felsinger(Architect), Dee Ferris(Artist), Atelier One(Structural Eng.), Paul Gillieron(Acoustic designer). Assisted by Lorene Faure and Damjan Iliev.    Our response:&lt;br/&gt;A ROOM WITH FIVE VIEWS&lt;br/&gt;The location for the 'Room for London' was probably selected because of its incredible views east and west along the River Thames. To the west, The Houses of Parliament with the clocktower and 'Big Ben', the London Eye, and the Royal Festival Hall on the Southbank. In the east, the historic dome of St. Paul's Cathedral the towers of the Barbican Centre, the Gherkin and Tower 42 in the City of London. Across Waterloo Bridge there is Somerset House, and the ever-changing foreground of the River Thames with its passing boats and the ebb and flow of the tides. People constantly pass along The Queen's Walk below and gather in crowds drawn to pockets of activity all along the South bank.&lt;br/&gt;The Room for London is expected to host up to two guests, but we think, given the opportunity, they will probably be keen to invite a few of their closest friends, to marvel at the views and share the experience of this inspiring environment; to have conversations, to dine and to make the most of this retreat in the heart of London. We have designed it for 8 extra guests joining the invited inhabitants.&lt;br/&gt;At street level there exists a low-level space covered with graffiti, where skateboarders enjoy showing off their stunts. It's a streetwise, high energy, loud environment, both aesthetically and acoustically, looking up, as it does onto the riverbank and the continual movement of the passers-by.&lt;br/&gt;A Room With Five Views will stand in direct contrast to this existing streetwise 'niche', perching as it does, high above, on the concrete roof of the Queen Elizabeth Hall. It will be a retreat. An acoustically quieter space where, both indoors and outdoors, there will be an opportunity to leave the noise and bustle of London and enter a different environment. A place of calm and reflection.&lt;br/&gt;The room will be protected by its envelope and thermal glazing. Ventilation will be natural, via attenuated automatic louvers in the shell, which maintain the overall insulation. Internal acoustics quality will be very good, due to the convoluted inner form and the presence of added sound absorbing elements (including the contents). The room will be computer modeled and auralised before construction, so that the internal acoustic can be experienced in our 3D sound studio, or listened to on conventional stereo headphones. The external courtyard wall will act as an acoustic barrier, reducing traffic noise significantly.&lt;br/&gt;Five spaces with five different views and ambience; Four to the north, south, east and west, plus the dome of the sky; a muted view with no urban landscape, just the sky with moving clouds or blue on a clear day.&lt;br/&gt;Each niche extended by a collar consist of openings which function on a number of levels: As frames to the imposing London sights immediately outside; spaces to inhabit, protective enclosures in which to relax and unwind; and as &amp;quot;links&amp;quot; that blur the boundary between exterior and interior, both inviting the external ambience in (through abstracted form and colour) and, vice versa, as highlighted 'lips', taking the internal out and acting as soft beacons for passing viewers. The expansive nature of the design as a whole is mirrored in the creation of floor (made of an underlay of recycled car tires, 'regupol', and covered on top with a translucent silicone), which extends from indoors to outdoors continuously.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to each distinctive and varied aesthetic and sensory experience, the five niches could, as a whole, propose, a simple mode of living that would invite a quiet contemplative experience, in which the inhabitants are invited to move through the space in accordance with the    A possible scenario for a day in the life of the Room for London:&lt;br/&gt;One wakes up in the morning in the large space of the Western Niche, an impressive triangular opening that gives way to a warm, inviting space, wrapped with upholstery, and infused with a diffuse light. It houses a large bed (which can also be used as a sofa, before and after dinner, from which to take in the magnificent views towards the London Eye and the Houses of Parliament).&lt;br/&gt;Bathing takes place in the Northern Niche, a panoramic opening that reflects the horizontality of the river. Bath and sink are covered with a silicone matt (digitally printed) material, which introduces aspects of the view immediately outside - water, skies, treetops...&lt;br/&gt;Breakfast can be taken in the Eastern Niche, sitting (if two people) one opposite the other, and taking in the cool morning light and the view towards St. Pauls. The auroral atmosphere is reflected in a nimbus-like opening.&lt;br/&gt;There is an added portable table that can act as a table surface added to the east niche for breakfast when needed. This is a multifunctional mobile element, which usually hangs above the circular table in the middle of the room. It can serve as a trolley to serve drinks etc.&lt;br/&gt;Lunches and dinners may be enjoyed under the Skylight Niche, which is unique among the niches for its provision of an ambience of changing light. The nature of the material/painting of this niche means that it can enhance, or amplify, the daylight coming from above. At night, it will be lit with atmospheric light with the interior controlled by the guests, which in turn, can be seen from the exterior.&lt;br/&gt;Between meals the table could act as a desk if needed, with a strong natural and varying light source coming from above. Along the dining table - which is under the skylight - there are also two benches that one can add when necessary for the extra guests who might be invited. When weather permits, the Southern Niche offers the experience of an open-air English garden - with seating amid the fragrant roses planted amongst the green roof garden, and surrounded with a painted acoustic wall. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Architectural assistants:&lt;br/&gt;Damjan Iliev, architect&lt;br/&gt;Lauren Faure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preparation images - Yael Reisner and Dee Ferris:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Architectural assistant:&lt;br/&gt;Damjan Iliev, architect</description>

Through discussions with 16 leading architects, including Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Greg Lynn and Wolf Prix, unrivalled access is provided to the formative experiences, creative processes and motivations of some of the most influential design figures today. Through personal interviews with Yael Reisner, written up by Fleur Watson, the authors capture the voices, thoughts and personalities of their subjects. So rare and intimate are the insights that it is often akin to being a party to the very conversations themselves. The articles bring us up close to these creative minds with such widely differing positions and opinions, each expressing a very different point of view on aesthetics: whether they think beauty is integral or non-essential to architecture. Fascinating in what it tells us about individual architects and their work, most significantly Architecture and Beauty raises poignant issues regarding the place of beauty, aesthetics and self-expression within the psychology and the design process of the architectural avant-garde.         Wiley, 2010&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extracts from the book’s introduction &lt;br/&gt;- It is important to note that I wrote this book from the perspective of personal impression and based on an understanding of recent architectural events. That is, from the perspective of a designer-architect and not of an architectural historian. &lt;br/&gt;- In the book, each chapter has many footnotes as well 13-15 images in colour.  &lt;br/&gt;- This chapter in its full length is illustrated and has 56 footnotes that add further more information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genesis of a Troubled Relationship&lt;br/&gt;Yael Reisner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The genesis of this book’s subject matter came as a consequence of a long preoccupation with what I refer to as the ‘troubled relationship’ between architects and the content of their architecture as well as its relationship with form and aesthetics. Good architecture and brilliant buildings are mostly judged by their capacity to produce an aesthetic experience, yet many outside the architectural profession are surprised to discover that architectural design is neither led nor generated through a process that is engaged with aesthetical issues or visual thinking. Indeed, the diversity of response among these interviewees reveals, in itself, the complexity of this inherently troubled relationship. For many, beauty is a concept that doesn’t hold any value within architecture, while for others it has regained its importance and relevance through the framework of a new definition. For example, Frank Gehry sees ‘beauty’ as something “pretty and soft” and unconnected with buildings, while Thom Mayne finds the term difficult within itself though defines it as a being “compelled” to a particular type of architecture. For Gaetano Pesce, beauty is simply perfection, a notion he views as outdated and out of step with the fallible nature of human existence. Paradoxically, beauty can also be the very raison d’être of architecture: For Juhani Pallasmaa it provides the promise of a better human world, while for Odile Decq to be in denial of the importance of beauty is the rejection of a basic human right. Concluding interviewee Hernan Diaz Alonso provides a starkly contemporary viewpoint: For him beauty is integrally embedded within a playful exploration of the grotesque and horrific.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This poignant struggle is also encapsulated in the classic dyad of ‘content and form’ and how, as a principle, it is understood or perceived by architects of our time. As the Finnish architect Juhani Pallasmaa eloquently describes in his interview: “The discipline of architecture is ‘impure’ in the sense that it fuses utility and poetics, function and image, rationality and metaphysics, technology and art, economy and symbolization. Architecture is a muddle of irreconcilable things and categories.” Thus, it seems that the cultural and artistic facet of architecture is often undermined in favour of the more rational, pragmatic requirements of the discipline and, as such, drives this rarely confronted ‘troubled relationship’. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; read more &lt;br/&gt; The ‘hegemony of the eye’ with its ‘deceits’ haven’t gone well along the content in demand. The expression ‘hegemony of the eye’ – appears during the 20th century as a critic.&lt;br/&gt;…&lt;br/&gt;The historic struggle of the ‘troubled relationship’ between architectural content and form within the second half of the 20th century resonates with me at a distinctly personal level and has, over time, provided the provocation for my engagement with the notion of the difficult position that beauty holds within architecture. Since my youth I have always admired beautiful objects and adored the look of new things. I believe I was born with a sensitive eye which was developed during my childhood and adolescence despite growing up in the context of the Socialist Modernist and cosmopolitan culture of the provincial city of Tel-Aviv in the 1960s. (The Socialist attitude of Israelis was reinforced by the Jewish iconoclastic tradition.)  In the Israeli collective identity of that time and place was an idealisation of modernity and simplicity, where ideological debates were prevalent and aesthetic ‘indulgence’ was absent, frowned upon and treated as reminiscent of the old habits of the European Bourgeoisie. I suspect that the Modernist Socialist attitude of the people of Tel-Aviv was the major reason their city’s new beauty became diluted and has been badly treated. ‘Content’ was satisfying and more significant; as Tel-Avivians often remark: “We don’t argue about taste and smell”.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet my persistent attitude towards the look of things was mostly triggered by my father - a jolly Austro-Hungarian-Jewish intellectual, a chemical engineer whose heart belonged to European Modernist culture -  who rarely missed an opportunity to tease his daughter for her appreciation of things simply because of their appearance. ( He loved me dearly and put forward his views to ‘rescue’ me from what he saw as a shallow attitude to life, indulging with silly girlish occupation.) I was accused of adoring empty vessels rather than admiring ‘content’ produced by intellectual activity, which was, in my father’s opinion, worth critically appraising. Our conflict was reinforced daily by a famous Hebrew saying, ‘don’t look at the vase but at its content’, which finds its parallel in the English saying, ‘don’t judge a book by its cover’ – though it doesn’t translate directly since within the Hebrew expression we use a word related directly to the word ‘content’. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Projecting from my paternal influence, it was my observation that most intellectuals do not have a developed ‘eye’ with which to truly appreciate the range of values that can be captured within the ‘look of things’ – an observation that seemed underwritten by the context of Socialism. Indeed, they had no genuine interest in looking and set a blind eye to a visual set of references, creating a lack of visual sensibilities over time. I, therefore, assumed that being an intellectual meant the application of the written word through literature and poetry and even theatre to develop a quite different set of sensibilities; it didn’t matter if any object was defined by its ugliness, its originality of form, its beauty or its reflection on culture as it would always be reduced to the status of a mere decorative phenomenon. As I began to question this attitude my growing frustration fed my conviction and, in turn, the need for this book. This dialectic informs my research and drives my distrust of the collective message from cultural theory – and, more specifically, in architectural discourse – that the ‘content’ of cultural and creative output is more important than its ‘appearance’, and that the notion of ‘beauty’ is often misinterpreted as being devoid of intellectual depth. &lt;br/&gt;Living in London since the early 1990s I was struck by the disappointing fact that  architecture was predominantly discussed in terms of ethics, content or activity, and much less in terms of its imagery, look, visual values, composition or architectural language. While teaching at The Bartlett I had the opportunity to listen to a large number of lectures given by internationally renowned architects and I couldn’t help thinking that the architectural discourse of the time shared attitudes with the arguments I had heard in my youth – tragically it seemed to me that many architects had lost their conviction of the cultural importance of aesthetics and its ties with individuality. I hoped to find satisfaction in the shift that ‘digital architecture’ brought to the international stage, with its focus on form and appearance rather than content. Yet, disappointingly, the digital movement’s famous protagonists elevated the status of conceptual objectivity and pursued a ‘rational’ design process via computational processes. The rise of computer-generated design valued ‘automated’, ‘pseudo-scientific’ and intellectualised characteristics where originality evolved from intrinsic procedures derived from mathematics and not from an individualistic, aesthetic approach.&lt;br/&gt;…&lt;br/&gt;From a historical perspective, the origins of this troubled relationship throughout the 20th century can be traced to the beginnings of Functionalism where the Modernist ethos was embedded in Socialist ideologies. Since the 1930s architectural discourse has been dogged by the Modernist ambition to avoid being driven by aesthetics and, in turn, the desire not to involve the ‘self’ or ‘subjectivity’ during the design process. &lt;br/&gt;…&lt;br/&gt;As Banham suggests: “Nowhere among the major figures of the ’20s will a pure Functionalist be found.” From a contemporary viewpoint, we can conclude that the apologists succeeded in influencing the architectural discourse of the time and pursued an agenda that sidelined aesthetics as a generator for architecture of the 20th century; the generating forces had to be related to the world of utility. &lt;br/&gt;…&lt;br/&gt;As Colin Rowe confirms, “That opposition: ‘objective limits’ and ‘subjective license’, was a crucial component of the architecture thought of the time, and indicated that one is good and the other is highly dubious.” &lt;br/&gt;…&lt;br/&gt;Hence the resistance of Modern architects to embrace a subjective will, or least admit to its role in the creation of their architecture, begins. The popular mantra extracted from the European Functionalist ethos of ‘form follows function’ clearly reinforces the repression of individualistic expression and the utilitarian facet of Modernism that became the dominant attitude. Surprisingly, as Colin Rowe points out, at the time no-one actually admitted the incompatibility of the two concepts, shifting between an idea of the architect as the servant of technology, the impersonal, and the super important ‘facts’ and an idea of the architect as the executive of the Zeitgeist, responding to the unconscious demands of the day, interpreting his aesthetic preferences as prophetic intuitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Modernist intellectual attitude is also captured by the well-known British social historian Eric Hobsbawm,  who wrote in the 1990s: “Films depended on books from the start…” (Eric Hobsbawm, Behind the Times, The Decline and Fall of the Twentieth Century Avant Gardes, Thames and Hudson, 1998.)That is, the underlying message is the most significant value that comes with a film, though he clearly recognises the visual powers and importance of the cinema. In his book Age of Extremes , in 1994, Hobsbaum expands on his thoughts: “One of the most obscure questions in history; and for the historian of culture, one of the most central, is the very phenomenon that brilliant fashion designers, a notoriously non-analytic breed, sometimes succeed in anticipating the shape of things to come better than professional predictors.”( E.H. related his argument to fashion only because it engages with the masses on a fundamental level.) This comment succinctly expresses a refusal to recognise the intellectual depth that can be captured in visual imagery generated intuitively by an individual’s insight and a lack of respect for the image unless it carries strong social political content, or a ‘utilitarian task’. The intellectualisation of the thought process is prevalent generally in our culture and it has led to further support of the rational faculties as evidenced in architecture’s design process. As Walter J. Ong explains, Democracy’s ‘public opinion’ took over individual taste and power. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It took until the late 1970s for emotional content to re-emerge in architecture and for aesthetically driven design to achieve positive status while facilitating the role of the ‘eye’ once more. This new architectural spirit was led by the dynamic work of Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Coop Himmelb(l)au and Daniel Libeskind and propelled into international prominence by the exhibition ‘Deconstructivist Architecture’, curated by Mark Wigley with Philip Johnson at New York’s Museum of Modern Art in 1988.  The exhibition’s enticing title distracted from the content of the architecture displayed, hijacked the architectural scene and ignited a fire among many architects who must have had an incredible thirst for philosophy or for a cerebral authority rather than for embracing an emotional, authorial voice to lead their architecture.  While resoundingly important and highly successful, the ‘Decon’ show really indicated the end of a discussion, and, immediately afterwards, the philosophy of Jacques Derrida strengthened as one of the primary authorities in the design process. Thus content became more significant than aesthetics, underpinning a return to the historical architectural tradition of rejecting the ‘self’, with all its emotional involvement, as an authority &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the 1990s the use of computers became a prevalent phenomenon in architectural schools and offices and influenced the design process tremendously by enabling more complexity in architectural organisation, three-dimensional forms and structure along with virtual representation and simulations. With this radical shift, the first wave of influential ‘digital architects’ arrived on the architectural scene –  such as Greg Lynn, Lars Spuybroek, Marcos Novak, Mark Goulthorpe/dECOi and Mark Burry/SIAL. (‘Digital architects’ embrace a complete computational design process using the computer as a design tool from early sketches, developed drawings, drawn models and working drawings through to final products manufactured and produced by rapid prototyping machines) Collectively and individually they took the architectural discourse of the time by storm, drawing on mathematics and the influence of the work of philosopher Gilles Deleuze to provide joint authorities for generating the work and, in turn, swinging the focus back to form and, apparently, back to cerebral aesthetics. However, rationality prevailed and the architect’s ‘eye’ and individuality were removed from the design process, but this time in the name of new objectified computational technologies and production. Content – as it was often claimed – became fused with form, and form was arrived at through cerebral computational process and technique. &lt;br/&gt;….&lt;br/&gt;When embarking on the research material to explore my preoccupation, I felt it was critical to establish direct contact with the architectural elite and chose to interview architects who are or were highly influential among fellow architects and students of architecture – usually architects whose work I respect and find attractive, though I do not necessarily agree with their schools of thought. There are sixteen interviewees, who provide a rich cross section of opinion but who don’t necessarily represent the widest range of views. Collectively they represent only a small sample of a potentially large number of architects with equally valuable opinions who might have been included. I met most of them two or three times over a span of nearly three years (2004–2007). All 16 interviewees are or have been leading architectural educators and are generally considered mavericks who have moved architecture forward through talent, originality, integrity and individuality. In attempting to understand each architect’s value system, I drew on my personal experience of struggling with the ‘troubled relationship’ to get them talk about that subject.. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frank Gehry exposes the poignancy of self-expression in architecture in democratic societies. Peter Cook hankers for the time in history when architects engaged in passionate battles over their different styles. Eric Owen Moss believes architecture encompasses a colossal breadth of experience in art, history and prosaic pragmatics, and that the expression of these things has built up the integrity of architects as individuals reflecting on their times. Will Alsop argues that individuality is the very thing that architects can offer, believing in the ‘diverse’ and the ‘speculative’ and fighting long, arduous battles with British critics and conservatives. Like Odile Decq, Wolf D. Prix vehemently believes that architectural practice shouldn’t be separated from architectural theory and research; that architecture functions as both a reflection on architects’ cultural backgrounds and a general register of culture. For Zvi Hecker, architecture is an expression of the human soul in its ever-changing condition, whereas Juhani Pallasmaa points to the missing presence of the ‘self’ and believes that architects should rely on personal experience and imagination to fuel their work. For Thom Mayne it is the very uniqueness of architecture that allows it to operate on so many levels – conceptual, social, cultural, historical, urbanistic – loading multiple perspectives into single frames. Greg Lynn and Mark Goulthorpe claim that content is always fused with form; their interest is focused on form generated by computational processes. Kolatan-MacDonald – unlike many of their digital colleagues – bravely introduced lateral thinking to the computational process in the mid-1990s, though they still reject any suggestion of Deterministic Formalism. Heranan Diaz Alonso, as the youngest (and final) interviewee, has liberated himself from the cerebral design process and many of the rules of his digital colleagues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an architect who has spent years battling with the suppression of the ‘eye’ and the ‘I’ and its role in the design process of so many architects, I especially identify with the American psychologist James Hillman who wrote: “This curious refusal to admit beauty in psychological discourse occurs even though each of us knows that nothing so affects the soul, so transports it, as moments of beauty – in nature, a face, a song, an action or dream.” &lt;br/&gt;9 Bill Beckley with David Shapiro, Uncontrollable Beauty, Towards a New Aesthetics, Allworth Press, NY, 1998; ‘The Practice of Beauty, an Essay’, by James Hillman,) And, as he suggests, “We [are] left with fractals and wittily named particles [by definition non-sensate] of theoretical physics,  the puns and parodies of architecture, and the language games of philosophical analysis resulting in a severe dissociation between what is thought, said, and written and what the senses see, the heart feels, and the world suffers.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More architects should confidently accept the need to generate architecture with an authorial voice, embrace an intuitive eye and lateral thinking, seize impulses and become individualistically speculative. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beauty as a concept for our age, a work of the individual for other individuals, an authentic product for a pluralistic global time, is not a singular idea. The beautiful is seen by many and is therefore an ‘uncontrollable beauty’. (After the inspiring book Uncontrollable Beauty. Bill Beckley with David Shapiro, Uncontrollable Beauty, Towards a New Aesthetics, Allworth Press, NY, 1999.)  It is time to argue that architecture’s ‘aesthetics’ have the power to synthesise values, poetics, pragmatic constraints and overbearing cultural issues, and at the same time cohere to the construct of the architectural design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;file://localhost/Users/yaelreisner/Desktop/bryn/YaelReisnerWebsite/Projects/Entries/1994/1/25_Dadush_Residence,_Tel_Aviv,_1993_-_1994_files/dad.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;file://localhost/Users/yaelreisner/Desktop/bryn/YaelReisnerWebsite/Projects/Media/object099_1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:left; padding-right:10px; padding-bottom:10px; width:216px; height:27px;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One of the main reasons that the clients liked this overall concept was to do with the fact that each insert - whether it was the sofa as part of the living room, or the extra toilet room - were located halfway into the living and bedroom, therefore only having half of their presence in the main rooms. This resulted in the main rooms feeling larger and more spacious. In addition to this, most of the flat was built by the client and so cheaper in the long run. The apartment's colour scheme was inspired by a traditional Armenian tile - Susan's choice - that had been used in the bathroom: there was white, ochre and deep blue.&lt;br/&gt;It was a pleasure to work with clients who basically let me do the design work, as I understood how to best fit - functionally and aesthetically - their brief. The contractor would measure the design's success through its functionality and efficiency, though he reminded me often to contribute my architectural thinking to his brief. I had to rationalise my aesthetically-driven attitude through what was considered good in the client's mind: an efficient use of space. For example, by having the sofa built into a hole with only half of its width visible would save space and money, as he would not have to buy a new sofa. Of course, the aesthetic reason for installing these 'functional boxes' into the wall was no less important: the different heights made the wall feel lighter and look more interesting. The 'toilet box' was particularly successful: most people were taken by surprise to find an extra toilet in a public space. It was 'hanging' on the wall (by cantilever) and was not at all overt about its function.&lt;br/&gt;The most frustrating aspect of this job was the fact that on site the work was being done in such a basic manner. We were not in a remote or poor place: we were in Tel-Aviv, a very dynamic city with a modern, sophisticated culture. I decided that on my next project I would look for an alternative way of realising my plans with the minimum involvement of unskilled work on site, and I felt lucky that the conditions of the next project allowed me to fulfil that ambition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

It was a competition for a project intended to be built and I was very interested in bringing my work to London, searching for projects in London or in the UK in general.  The competition was a popular one amongst young architects and was run by the RIAS (the Scottish equivalent of the RIBA). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I worked on this competition in collaboration with the structural engineer Niel Thomas, founder of Atelier One, and the environmental engineer Patrick Bellew, the founder of Atelier Ten; at the time they worked together on many projects. I invited them to work with me on this occasion by sending them a black and white postcard of my Tel-Aviv promenade asking if they were interested in collaborating with me; they agreed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Holy Island is a 4 km long by less than a kilometre wide mountainous island, located off the coast of Arran in the Firth of Clyde (not very far from Glasgow).  The island has a long spiritual history: it is endowed with an ancient healing spring, the hermit-cave of a 6th Century monk, St Molaise, and evidence of a 13th Century Christian monastery.  The Tibetan Buddhist centre from Samye Ling was presented this island in 1992 as a gift from a private owner, in order to build a centre for the public and a monastery for the coming millennium. Lama Yeshe was the executive director of The Holy Island Project. Part of the program was to design a monastery for the 21st century: as a spiritual place with an ecological sustainable attitude.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were three major parts to the complex: a residential territory for the spiritual teacher Lama Yeshe and for his guests who often come with an entourage, and two monasteries, one for monks and one for nuns.  Each must include private single rooms - where they would spend their long hours - communal showers and toilets, a praying room, a yoga room, a dining room with a kitchen next to it, washing room and a workshop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I worked out the project with the aid of a big model (approximately 2 x 2m) by myself, for three months. I made the topography from flat, flexible cork sheets and the buildings from the same white plastic sheets I worked with in the Tel-Aviv promenade project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I designed all these facilities around a courtyard, lying along the mountain slopes where the main entrance led to the courtyard in its lower part, not very far from the sea shore, with the kitchen and dining room facing south and the sea.  The workshop was the same, including the lower part next to the entrance where the goods arrive from.  The room layout looked in plan like many hands stretching into the landscape with each ‘hand’ layered in two floors. The monks are there to be in solitude while they spend long hours in a specific ‘sit-box’ in the middle of the room.  When they are out of their rooms it is for a scheduled activity within their community and they gather in the bigger communal rooms.  Therefore, in each room, the box they would sit in was surrounded by walls with no interruptions, while the openings were continuous windows skirting the point where the walls meet the ceiling, looking on to the sky. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The praying room and the yoga room were located in the upper part of the courtyard, looking onto breathtaking views: down through the open courtyard, into the island and the sea and up toward the peak of the rocky mountain which was covered with pink heather in summer and low shrubs all year long (there were hardly any trees on this island). The same distinctive walls continued from the monasteries’ courtyards leading towards a gazebo further up on the mountain, towards its peak and distanced from the monastery’s complex.  All along the walls, in the courtyard and all the way up to the gazeboes, there were cylinders spinning as part of the walls’ design, using the prevalent strong winds to create the energy source for that complex.  These were inspired by a common sight in Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in Tibet where cylinders spinning around were connected with the local tradition of symbolizing reading scrolls as they were spinning around. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of aesthetics, I continued with my soft language of flat, long, undisturbed, dynamic white concrete strips.  The buildings were designed  in such a way that light would come in from between light concrete strips, or between a strip and ceiling or between a strip and the floor.  The sky had a big presence in this scheme, with views revealed in between the wall strips with which I framed the sky, the only nature present in the monks’ and nuns’ private rooms, where they spend most of their time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

That tree became the main view of the flat's public space. Lines on the plans were orientated so as to increase the focus on the tree, and the flat was arranged to enhance this view.&lt;br/&gt;I built a pergola on the roof that developed from the design concepts I came up with in Luciano Berio House, a project I designed as a student at the AA in 1985, but instead of the wooden pergola as in the southern elevation of the courtyard, I opted for a corten pergola ove here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;file://localhost/Users/yaelreisner/Desktop/bryn/YaelReisnerWebsite/Projects/Entries/1985/1/25_Luciano_Berio_Project,_Student_Work,_1985_files/ber.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;file://localhost/Users/yaelreisner/Desktop/bryn/YaelReisnerWebsite/Projects/Media/object010_1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:left; padding-right:10px; padding-bottom:10px; width:216px; height:27px;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I still like this project, which at the time felt like a breakthrough. As a fourth year student, in the summer of 1985, I designed a house and studio for the Italian contemporary composer Luciano Berio. Again, it was my choice, brief and location. Before the design work started I was listening to his music in a record shop following an exposure to it by a radio recording from Edinburgh's summer Festival. The piece I was most inspired by was a song which started with a long period of whispering. Those voices made me think of wheat fields in a light wind. I imagined the house situated in a middle of a wheat field in the Western part of Tuscany, where the surrounding environment changes with the seasons just as the wheat field changes its appearance: lined brown clods of earth sprout short, green, thin stems which grow into the yellow-gold beautiful wheat, tall in its prime. Throughout the year the sound of the wind through the wheat changes, the colour changes, and the wheat's height changes, affecting the house's relative scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I started to work on the design, at first through many sketches of silhouettes rising above the open field. I used a thick, black felt-tip pen (I have always had a better line with this than with pencil) and drew many sketches very fast, so as to capture a certain dynamic, while listening to Berio's vocal track which I liked. As I developed my ideas I added a wooden path to walk on - a wooden path with a slight wobble; The long, flat wooden beams sat on heavy springs so that you were forced to slow down; the walk became a sensual experience, as if you were swaying with the wheat. There was also a long triple bench, a fixed, stable one so you could sit on three different levels at three different heights outside the house territory (this is actually still in the field, on the leading path towards the houses); this allowed you to enjoy the smell of the soil, the growing field and change of colour and size throughout the year, while watching the sun's path in the sky above the open field. The entrance to the courtyard was from its southern side and was signed with tall thin dark plastic sticks, which stood vertically like the wheat stems. The courtyard was in shadow as its canopy reached the ground on its eastern side, with the house situated on its west. The southern side had the entrance feature and the north side was opened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From far away the complex of the bench, the courtyard, the house and the very high detached 'viewing balcony' (much higher than the roofs of the house and studio), all appeared as one big silhouette rising above the wide open field of wheat full in its growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
